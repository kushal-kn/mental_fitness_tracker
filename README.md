# Mood Predictor using Random Forest Regression
This project is a mood predictor that utilizes a Random Forest Regression model to predict mood levels based on various features related to mental health and substance use.

## Features
* Predicts mood levels based on features such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorder, anxiety, drug usage, depression, and alcohol consumption.
* Provides an interpretation of the predicted mood level (e.g., Very Low Mood, Low Mood, Moderate Mood, High Mood).
   
## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

1. NumPy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn
4. Google Colab (if using Google Colab environment)
   
## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. If using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive to access the provided CSV files containing mental health data.
3. Run the mood_predictor.ipynb notebook or execute the Python script mood_predictor.py.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the features for the person whose mood you want to predict.
5. View the predicted mood level along with its interpretation.
